VLVector
========
This assignment was given during the Covid-19 quarantine, as part of the Hebrew University C++ workshop course.
The idea was to implement a virtual length vector (generic container), that would use a given parameter as the initial size of a stack vector.
As the VLvector grows larger, it begins to use dynamic memory. similarly, it switches to stack memory on shrinking.
